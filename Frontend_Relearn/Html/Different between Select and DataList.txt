While <select> and <datalist> share some similarities, there are some major differences. 
In the associated <input> element, users can type in the input field to search for a particular option. 
If none of the <option>s match, the user can still use what they typed in. 
When the form is submitted, the value of the <input>â€˜s name and the value of the option selected, or what the user typed in, is sent as a pair.
